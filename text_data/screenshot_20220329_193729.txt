‘I find you willing, the ghost said, ‘and if you didn’t act on this you would be more drowsy than the fat
weed that roots itself in the comfort of the banks of Lethe, the river of forgetfulness. Now Hamlet,
hear: It's been reported that, sleeping in my orchard, a snake bit me. So the ear of Denmark has
been grossly abused by a fraudulent account of my death.’ The ghost paused again and seemed to
be overwhelmed by the thought he had just pronounced. Then his voice came again, as steady and
cold as it had been up until now. ‘But know this, you noble youth. The serpent that did take your
father’s life now wears his crown.’
