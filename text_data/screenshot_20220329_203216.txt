KING CLAUDIUS

It likes us well;

And at our more consider'd time well read,
Answer, and think upon this business.

Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:

Most welcome home!

Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS
LORD POLONIUS

This business is well ended.

My liege, and madam, to expostulate

What majesty should be, what duty is,

Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,

And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
I will be brief: your noble son is mad:

Mad call 1 it; for, to define true madness,

What is't but to be nothing else but mad?

But let that go.
