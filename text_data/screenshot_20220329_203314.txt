HAMLET

Words, words, words.

LORD POLONIUS

What is the matter, my lord?

HAMLET

Between who?

LORD POLONIUS

I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
HAMLET

Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here

that old men have grey beards, that their faces are
wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
though | most powerfully and potently believe, yet

I 'hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for
yourself, sir, should be old as | am, if like a crab

you could go backward.
