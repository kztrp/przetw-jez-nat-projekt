‘And then it started like a guilty thing hearing a fearful summons,’ said Horatio. ‘I have heard it said
that the cock, the trumpeter of the morning, wakes the god of day and at that warning, whether it's
in the sea, or in fire, on the earth or in the air, the wandering and erring spirits retreat to their
prisons. What we've seen this morning is proof of that story.”

‘It faded on the crowing of the cock,’ agreed Marcellus. ‘Some say that at Christmas time the bird of
dawn actually sings all night. And then, they say, no spirit dares roam. The nights are wholesome: the
planets are stable: neither fairy nor witch has any power, so holy and gracious is that time."

‘I've heard that too,’ said Horatio, and | partly believe it. But look, the morning, dressed in it's russet
mantle , is coming over the dew of that high eastern hill. Let's break the watch up. My advice is that
we tell young Hamlet of what we've seen tonight. I'l bet my life that this spirit, dumb to us, will speak
to him. Do you agree we should tell him out of our friendship and duty to him?"

‘Let's do that,’ said Marcellus. ‘Il know where we'll find him."
