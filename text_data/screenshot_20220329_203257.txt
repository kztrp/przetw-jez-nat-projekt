LORD POLONIUS

[Pointing to his head and shoulder]

Take this from this, if this be otherwise:

If circumstances lead me, | will find

Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
Within the centre.

KING CLAUDIUS
How may we try it further?
LORD POLONIUS

You know, sometimes he walks four hours together
Here in the lobby.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

So he does indeed.
