‘Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,

He swung about his head and cut the winds,

‘Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scomn:
‘While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Came more and more and fought on part and pat,
“Till the prince came, who parted either part.

LADY MONTAGUE

0, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

BENVOLIO

Madam, an hour before the worshippd sun
Peerd forth the golden window of the east,

A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
‘Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
‘That westward rooteth from the city's side,

So early walking did I see your son:

Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
And stole into the covert of the wood:

1, measuring his affections by my own,

‘That most are busied when they're most alone,
Pursued my humour not pursuing his,

And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.

MONTAGUE

Many a morning hath he there been seen,

‘With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
Butall 50 s00n as the all-cheering sun

Should in the furthest east begin to draw

‘The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,

Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
‘And private in his chamber pens himsel,

Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
And makes himself an artificial night:

Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.

BENVOLIO

My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
MONTAGUE

I neither know it nor can learn of him.
BENVOLIO

Have you importuned him by any means?
