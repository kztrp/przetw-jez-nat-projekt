LORD POLONIUS

At such a time Il loose my daughter to him:
Be you and | behind an arras then;

Mark the encounter: if he love her not

And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
Let me be no assistant for a state,

But keep a farm and carters.

KING CLAUDIUS

We will try it.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
LORD POLONIUS

Away, | do beseech you, both away:
I'll board him presently.

Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and Attendants
Enter HAMLET, reading

O, give me leave:
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
