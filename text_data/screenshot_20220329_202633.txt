BENVOLIO

At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
With all the admired beauties of Verona:

Go thither; and, with unatainted eye,
Compare her face with some that I shall show,
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

ROMEO

‘When the devout religion of mine eye
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
And these, who often drown'd could never die,
‘Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!

One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun

Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.

BENVOLIO

“Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
Herself poised with herself in either eye:
But in that crystal scales let there be w
Your lady's love against some other maid
‘That I will show you shining at this feast,
And she shall scant show well that now shows best.

ROMEO

Il go along, no such sight to be shown,
But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
