The voice faded and the figure merged with the mist.

Hamlet's heart was beating fast. In the name of all the angels, of earth, and even hell, don't let his
heart burst! And don't let his muscles fail him, but hold him up. Remember him! Yes, as long as
memory would last in his confused brain. Remember him! Yes, he would erase every other foolish
memory - everything he had read, people he had known, all the troubles he'd had in his life, and the
ghost's commandment would be the only thing that lived in the book of his mind, uncomplicated by
the presence of irrelevant things. He swore to that. He doubled his body over, as though in physical
pain. Oh most pernicious woman. Oh villain, villain, smiling damned villain! His slate. He would have
to write it down. He pulled the small slate and a piece of chalk out of his pocket. That one may smile
and smile and be a villain! That was at least certain in Denmark. He made a few notes in the dawn
light. ‘So, Uncle, there you are,’ he said aloud. ‘It's adieu, adieu! Remember me!’ He put the slate
away. There. | have sworn it."

Horatio's voice called: ‘My lord, my lord!"

‘Lord Hamlet!" shouted Marcellus.

The voices came nearer. ‘Heaven keep him safe,’ said Horatio.
‘Amen!’ shouted Hamlet.

They were peering through the mist. Horatio cupped his hands round his mouth and called like a
falconer. 'Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!"
