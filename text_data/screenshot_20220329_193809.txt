‘I swear," said Horatio

‘I too,’ said Marcellus.

Hamlet drew his sword. ‘On my sword,’ he said.
‘We've already sworn,’ said Marcellus.

‘On my sword. | insist."

A ghostly voice came from below: ‘Swear!"

‘Aha, boy!" exclaimed Hamlet. 'Is that you? Are you there, my honest friend, Truepenny? Come on,
you heard this fellow in the basement. Agree to swear.’

‘Word the oath, my lord.”
‘Never to say a word about what you've seen. Swear on my sword."
The ghostly voice came again: ‘Swear!’

Hamlet crouched and addressed the stone floor. ‘Hic et ubique? Then we'll move away.’ He walked
several paces away and beckoned the others. ‘Come here, gentlemen, and lay your hands on my
sword. Never to speak of this. Swear by my sword."

As they approached the voice came yet again.
