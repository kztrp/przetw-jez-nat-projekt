‘You're absolutely right, said Hamlet. And so, without any more ado, | think it would be fit that we
shake hands and part - you to your business or your pleasure, whatever it is, and I........ 'm going to

go and pray.’

‘Your words are wild and meaningless, my lord,” said Horatio.
‘I'm sorry they offend you. Heartily. Yes, indeed, heartily.’
‘There's no offence in them, my lord."

‘Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio. And a great deal of offence too. About this vision, it's an
honest ghost, let me tell that. As for your desire to know what happened between us, suppress it as
well as you can. And now, good friends, because you are friends - scholars and soldiers - grant me
one small request.’

‘Whatever it is, my lord, we will,” said Horatio.
‘Never tell anyone what you've seen tonight.”

They both assured him of that.
