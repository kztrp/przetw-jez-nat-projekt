HAMLET

Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be
one man picked out of ten thousand.

LORD POLONIUS
That's very true, my lord.
HAMLET

For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a
god kissing carrion,-Have you a daughter?

LORD POLONIUS
I have, my lord.
HAMLET

Let her not walk i the sun: conception is a
blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.
Friend, look to ‘t.

LORD POLONIUS

[Aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my
daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said |
was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and
truly in my youth | suffered much extremity for
love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.
‘What do you read, my lord?

HAMLET

Words, words, words.
