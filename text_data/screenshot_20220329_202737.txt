ROMEO
‘What is her mother?

Nurse

Marry, bachelor,

Her mother is the lady of the house,

And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous

I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
Shall'have the chinks.

ROMEO

Is she a Capulet?
O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.

BENVOLIO

Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
ROMEO

Ay, so1 fear; the more is my unrest.

CAPULET

Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;

‘We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.

Is it €'en 502 why, then, I thank you all

I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
More torches here! Come on then, lets to bed.
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:

Il to my rest.

Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse
