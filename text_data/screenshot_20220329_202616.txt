BENVOLIO
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
ROMEO

She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
For beauty starved with her severity

Cuts beauty off from all posterity.

She i too fair, too wise, wisely (oo fair,

“To merit bliss by making me despair:

She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow

Do live dead that live to tell it now.

BENVOLIO

Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
ROMEO

0, teach me how I should forget to think.
BENVOLIO

By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
Examine other beauties.

ROMEO

Tis the way
To call hers exquisite, in question more:

‘These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows.
Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
He that i strucken blind cannot forget

‘The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,

‘What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
‘Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
