ROMEO
Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
Servant

Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
pray, can you read any thing you see?

ROMEO

Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
Servant

Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
ROMEO

Stay, fellow; I can read.

Reads

“Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;

nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
‘Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
assembly: whither should they come?
