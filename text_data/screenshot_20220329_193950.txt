‘That | can keep your secrets and not my own. Anyway, to be interrogated by a sponge! What
rejoinder should the son of a king make?’

‘Do you take me for a sponge, my lord? said Rosencrantz.

‘Yes, sir, soaking up the king's face, his rewards, his offices. But such functionaries give the king the
best service in the end: like an ape, he keeps them in the corner of his jaw, first mouthed and finally
swallowed. When he needs what you've found out it's just a matter of squeezing you..." Hamlet made
the motion of squeezing a sponge: and sponge, you will be dry again.’
