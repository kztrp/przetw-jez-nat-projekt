ROMEO

0, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night

Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;

Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!

So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
As yonder lady o her fellows shows.

‘The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Did my heart love ill now? forswear i, sight!
For I neer saw true beauty till this night.

TYBALT

‘This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,

To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?

Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,

To strike him dead, T hold it not a sin.

CAPULET
‘Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
TYBALT
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,

Avillain that s hither come in spite,
“To scom at our solemnity this night.
