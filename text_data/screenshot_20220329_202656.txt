SCENE IV. A street.

Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others
ROMEO

‘What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
Or shall we on without a apology?

BENVOLIO

‘The date is out of such prolixity:
‘Welll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;

Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
After the prompter, for our entrance:

But let them measure us by what they will;
‘We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.

ROMEO

Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
Being but heavy, I will bear the light.

MERCUTIO

Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
ROMEO

Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes

‘With nimble soles: T have a soul of lead

So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
MERCUTIO

You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
And soar with them above a common bound.

ROMEO

Lam too sore enpierced with his shaft
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
1 cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
