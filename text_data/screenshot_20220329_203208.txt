LORD POLONIUS

Have |, my lord? | assure my good liege,

I hold my duty, as | hold my soul,

Both to my God and to my gracious king:
And | do think, or else this brain of mine
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure

As it hath used to do, that | have found
The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.

KING CLAUDIUS
0, speak of that; that do | long to hear.
LORD POLONIUS

Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.

KING CLAUDIUS
Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.

Exit POLONIUS
