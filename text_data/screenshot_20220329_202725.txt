TYBALT
‘Why, uncle, 'is a shame.
CAPULET

Goto, goto;

You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?

‘This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
You must contrary me! marry, ‘s time.

‘Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:

Be quiet, or-More light, more light! For shame!
T'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!

TYBALT

Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
T will withdraw: but this intrusion shall

Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.

ROMEO
[To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:

My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

JULIET

Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
‘Which mannerly devotion shows in this;

For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
