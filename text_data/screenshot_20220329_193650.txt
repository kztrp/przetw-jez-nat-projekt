‘Who are you and why do you disturb our watch, dressed in the armour of the dead King of
Denmark?’ Horatio demanded. ‘In the name of God, speak!"

The ghost turned and glided away.

‘It's offended,’ said Marcellus.

‘Look how it stalks away,” said Bernardo.

‘Stop! Speak! Speak! | command you to speak!" Horatio yelled.
The ghost disappeared into the fog.

‘Now it's gone and won't answer,’ said Marcellus.

Bernardo chuckled. ‘What's the matter, Horatio? You tremble and you're pale. Isn't this something
more than fantasy? What do you think now?"
