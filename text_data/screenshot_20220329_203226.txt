LORD POLONIUS

I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
When I had seen this hot love on the wing-

As | perceived it, | must tell you that,

Before my daughter told me-what might you,
Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,

If I had play'd the desk or table-book,

Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;

‘What might you think? No, | went round to work,
And my young mistress thus | did bespeak:
‘Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;

This must not be’ and then | precepts gave her,
That she should lock herself from his resort,
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
‘Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
And he, repulsed-a short tale to make-

Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,

Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
Into the madness wherein now he raves,

And all we mourn for.

KING CLAUDIUS
Do you think ‘tis this?
QUEEN GERTRUDE

It may be, very likely.
