The ghost turned its head slightly towards the east then looked at Hamlet again. ‘I think | can smell
the morning air,’ it said. ‘Let me be brief. Sleeping in my orchard, which, as you know, was my custom
in the afternoon, your uncle crept up with a vial of poisonous yew when he was certain that | would
be asleep and poured the poisonous liquid into my ear. This substance is so alien to a man’s blood
that it glides rapidly, like quicksilver, through the veins and arteries, and with mighty energy, thickens
and curdles the thin and wholesome blood like lemon juice in milk. And so it did mine. | was instantly
scurvy, like a leper, my smooth body covered with vile and loathsome scabs. And in that way,
sleeping, at the hands of a brother, | was summarily deprived of my life, my queen and my crown. |
was cut off, right in the fullness of my sins, without benefit of sacrament or the last rites of
repentance, no chance of atonement, but sent to my judgment with all my imperfections on my
head.

The ghost raised its head and looked at Hamlet with infinite sadness. Hamlet stared, horrified.

‘Oh horrible! Oh horrible! Most horrible!’ The ghost took a moment before it continued. ‘If you ever
loved your father refuse to accept it. Don't allow the royal bed of Denmark to be a couch for lechery
and damnable incest. However you decide to pursue this act, do not let it corrupt your mind, nor let
your soul contrive against your mother. Leave it to heaven to deal with, and to her conscience that
will prick and sting her heart like thorns. Farewell. The fading stars show the morning to be near.
Adieu, adieu, Hamlet. Remember me.’
