MERCUTIO

0, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
She s the fairies' midwife, and she comes.

In shape no bigger than an agate-stone

On the fore-finger of an alderman,

Drawn with a team of little atomies

Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;

Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
‘The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,

‘The traces of the smallest spider’s web,

‘The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,

Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,

Not so big as a round litcle worm

Prickd from the lazy finger of a maid;

Her chariot s an empty hazel-nut

Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,

‘Time out o’ mind the fairies' coachmakers.

And in this state she gallops night by night
‘Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
Oer lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
Oer ladies " lips, who straight on kisses dream,
‘Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier’s nose,

And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;

And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s ail
Tickling a parson's nose as a lies asleep,

‘Then dreams, he of another benefice:

Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier’s neck,

And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,

Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
And sleeps again. This i that very Mab

“That plats the manes of horses in the night,

And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
‘Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
‘This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
‘That presses them and learns them first to bear,
Making them women of good carriage:

“This is she—
