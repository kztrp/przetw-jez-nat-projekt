JULIET
And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say L.
Nurse
Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
‘Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
An I might live to see thee married once,
Ihave my wish.

LADY CAPULET

Marry, that ‘marry’ is the very theme
I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,

Itis an honour that I dream not of.
Nurse

An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
T'would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.

LADY CAPULET

‘Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,

Are made already mothers: by my count,

1 was your mother much upon these years

‘That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
‘The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
