QUEEN GERTRUDE

Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
And | beseech you instantly to visit

My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.

GUILDENSTERN

Heavens make our presence and our practises
Pleasant and helpful to him!

QUEEN GERTRUDE

Ay, amen!

Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and some Attendants
Enter POLONIUS

LORD POLONIUS
