Bernardo climbed the stairs to the castle’s ramparts. It was a bitterly cold night. He made his way
carefully through the freezing fog to relieve Francisco of his guard duty. He saw a dim figure and

challenged him.

‘Who's there?

‘No, you answer me!’ It was Francisco’s voice. 'Stop and identify yourself!’
Bernardo stopped. ‘Long live the King!"

‘Bernardo?

‘Yes, It's me.
Francisco set off. He took a few steps then turned and called to Bernardo: ‘I think | can hear them
now.’ He went to meet them. ‘'Stop! Who's there?”

‘Friends,’ said Horatio.

‘And loyal subjects of the king,’ said Marcellus.

‘Well goodnight to you, friends,’ said Francisco.

‘And to you, honest soldier, said Marcellus. ‘Who's relieved you?
‘Bernardo. Once again, good night."

'Ho, Bernardo,’ called Marcellus.

Tell me, is Horatio with you?' said Bernardo.
‘Horatio says it's all in our imaginations and doesn't believe we've seen it twice,’ said Marcellus. ‘Even
though we have, so I've brought him with me on the night watch. If this ghost comes again he'll see it
with his own eyes.’

‘Tut, tut, nonsense! It won't appear! said Horatio.

‘Just sit down and let us tell you the story that you won't believe: tell you what we've seen two nights
inarow.’

Horatio laughed and dismissed them with a wave of his hand. ‘Well let's sit down anyway, and listen
to Bernardo.’

‘Last night,’ began Bernardo, ‘when that star that's to the west of the North pole had crossed the sky
to where to it is now, Marcellus and | were sitting here when the bell struck one...."
‘Who are you and why do you disturb our watch, dressed in the armour of the dead King of
Denmark?’ Horatio demanded. ‘In the name of God, speak!"

The ghost turned and glided away.

‘It's offended,’ said Marcellus.

‘Look how it stalks away,” said Bernardo.

‘Stop! Speak! Speak! | command you to speak!" Horatio yelled.
The ghost disappeared into the fog.

‘Now it's gone and won't answer,’ said Marcellus.

Bernardo chuckled. ‘What's the matter, Horatio? You tremble and you're pale. Isn't this something
more than fantasy? What do you think now?"
‘Alright then,’ said Marcellus. * Sit down again and tell me, whoever can, why we have to do this guard
duty every night! And why they're making more and more cannons every day, and why there is such
a brisk market in weapons and why shipwrights have to labour on Sunday. What's going on that
everyone's working so hard night and day? Who can tell me?'
‘| can, said Horatio. ‘At least | can tell you the rumours. Our late King, whose ghost we've just seen,
was challenged to a duel by Fortinbras, the King of Norway, who was driven by an envious pride. Our
valiant King Hamlet, as this part of our known world knew him, killed this Fortinbras, who by the
legal terms of the duel forfeited all his lands to his conqueror along with his life. Our King had lodged
a similar agreement, with Danish territories going to Norway if Fortinbras had won. Now, sir, the
young Fortinbras has grown up and, although he's a novice in war, he’s spoiling for a fight and has
assembled a gang of lawless troublemakers from the backwaters of Norway. For little more than
their daily food they will try and recover the lands lost in that duel. From what | can gather this is the
main reason for the watch and the frantic preparations for war.’

‘That makes sense,’ said Bernardo, ‘and it may be that this portentous figure that comes armed
through our watch, looking so much like the dead king, is the focus of these wars.’

‘It certainly stirs the imagination, said Horatio. ‘At the height of Rome’s might, just before the mighty
Julius Caesar was assassinated, graves opened and the dead walked the streets muttering and
wailing. Stars of flaming fire came as disasters from the sun, and the moon, which influences
Neptune’s watery empire, was eclipsed. Similar sightings, like warnings from heaven or prologues of
an ill omen about to happen, have been witnessed here, by our own countrymen.’

He saw the ghost coming slowly towards them. ‘But look!" he said, ‘the ghost comes again. I'l
approach it even though it might sweep me aside.’

The ghost walked past them without altering its pace.
Horatio followed it. ‘Stop, illusion! he commanded. ‘If you can make any sound or have a voice, speak
to me. If there's any good thing that has to be done that will give you peace and bring me grace,
speak to me. If you have any foreknowledge of your country’s fate, which perhaps prior knowledge
of may avoid, oh speak. Or if you have hoarded stolen treasure during your life, for which reasons,
they say, you spirits walk after death, tell me about it."

A cock crowed somewhere. The ghost continued walking.

‘Stop it, Marcellus!" Horatio tried to grasp it but his hands went right through it.
‘Shall I hit it with my spear?’ said Marcellus.

‘Do so if it won't stop,’ said Horatio.

‘It's here!’ said Bernardo, pointing.

‘No, it's here! said Horatio.

‘It's gone,’ said Marcellus. 'We wronged it, being so majestical, by threatening it with violence. It's
invulnerable, like the air. Our antics were a mockery.’

‘It was about to speak when the cock crew,’ said Bernardo.
‘And then it started like a guilty thing hearing a fearful summons,’ said Horatio. ‘I have heard it said
that the cock, the trumpeter of the morning, wakes the god of day and at that warning, whether it's
in the sea, or in fire, on the earth or in the air, the wandering and erring spirits retreat to their
prisons. What we've seen this morning is proof of that story.”

‘It faded on the crowing of the cock,’ agreed Marcellus. ‘Some say that at Christmas time the bird of
dawn actually sings all night. And then, they say, no spirit dares roam. The nights are wholesome: the
planets are stable: neither fairy nor witch has any power, so holy and gracious is that time."

‘I've heard that too,’ said Horatio, and | partly believe it. But look, the morning, dressed in it's russet
mantle , is coming over the dew of that high eastern hill. Let's break the watch up. My advice is that
we tell young Hamlet of what we've seen tonight. I'l bet my life that this spirit, dumb to us, will speak
to him. Do you agree we should tell him out of our friendship and duty to him?"

‘Let's do that,’ said Marcellus. ‘Il know where we'll find him."
‘I am your father's spirit, doomed for a certain time to walk the night, and for the day to burn in fires,
till the foul crimes done during my lifetime have been burnt and purged away. But that | am
forbidden to tell the secrets of my prison-house | could tell a tale whose lightest word would shrivel
up your soul, freeze your young blood, make your eyes start from their sockets and your hair stand
up on end like the quills of a frightened porcupine. But this eternal torture is not for ears of flesh and
blood. Listen, oh listen! If you ever loved your dear father ...

‘Oh God! It was too much for Hamlet.
‘I find you willing, the ghost said, ‘and if you didn’t act on this you would be more drowsy than the fat
weed that roots itself in the comfort of the banks of Lethe, the river of forgetfulness. Now Hamlet,
hear: It's been reported that, sleeping in my orchard, a snake bit me. So the ear of Denmark has
been grossly abused by a fraudulent account of my death.’ The ghost paused again and seemed to
be overwhelmed by the thought he had just pronounced. Then his voice came again, as steady and
cold as it had been up until now. ‘But know this, you noble youth. The serpent that did take your
father’s life now wears his crown.’
‘Oh, I had almost thought that!" exclaimed Hamlet. ‘My uncle!’

‘Yes, that incestuous, that adulterous, beast. With the witchcraft of his intelligence, with his traitorous
qualities - oh evil intelligence and qualities that have the power to seduce like that - he forced the
will of my most seeming-virtuous queen to his shameful lust. Oh Hamlet, what a falling-off was
there!’
Hamlet stood in shocked silence.

The ghost continued: ‘From me, whose love was of that dignity that it was of the same high order as
the vow | made to her in marriage, to descend to the level of a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
compared with mine! But in the same way as virtue will never allow itself to be seduced by lewdness,
even if it comes in the shape of heaven, lust, though disguised as a radiant angel, preys on the
garbage to be found in a holy bed.”
The ghost turned its head slightly towards the east then looked at Hamlet again. ‘I think | can smell
the morning air,’ it said. ‘Let me be brief. Sleeping in my orchard, which, as you know, was my custom
in the afternoon, your uncle crept up with a vial of poisonous yew when he was certain that | would
be asleep and poured the poisonous liquid into my ear. This substance is so alien to a man’s blood
that it glides rapidly, like quicksilver, through the veins and arteries, and with mighty energy, thickens
and curdles the thin and wholesome blood like lemon juice in milk. And so it did mine. | was instantly
scurvy, like a leper, my smooth body covered with vile and loathsome scabs. And in that way,
sleeping, at the hands of a brother, | was summarily deprived of my life, my queen and my crown. |
was cut off, right in the fullness of my sins, without benefit of sacrament or the last rites of
repentance, no chance of atonement, but sent to my judgment with all my imperfections on my
head.

The ghost raised its head and looked at Hamlet with infinite sadness. Hamlet stared, horrified.

‘Oh horrible! Oh horrible! Most horrible!’ The ghost took a moment before it continued. ‘If you ever
loved your father refuse to accept it. Don't allow the royal bed of Denmark to be a couch for lechery
and damnable incest. However you decide to pursue this act, do not let it corrupt your mind, nor let
your soul contrive against your mother. Leave it to heaven to deal with, and to her conscience that
will prick and sting her heart like thorns. Farewell. The fading stars show the morning to be near.
Adieu, adieu, Hamlet. Remember me.’
The voice faded and the figure merged with the mist.

Hamlet's heart was beating fast. In the name of all the angels, of earth, and even hell, don't let his
heart burst! And don't let his muscles fail him, but hold him up. Remember him! Yes, as long as
memory would last in his confused brain. Remember him! Yes, he would erase every other foolish
memory - everything he had read, people he had known, all the troubles he'd had in his life, and the
ghost's commandment would be the only thing that lived in the book of his mind, uncomplicated by
the presence of irrelevant things. He swore to that. He doubled his body over, as though in physical
pain. Oh most pernicious woman. Oh villain, villain, smiling damned villain! His slate. He would have
to write it down. He pulled the small slate and a piece of chalk out of his pocket. That one may smile
and smile and be a villain! That was at least certain in Denmark. He made a few notes in the dawn
light. ‘So, Uncle, there you are,’ he said aloud. ‘It's adieu, adieu! Remember me!’ He put the slate
away. There. | have sworn it."

Horatio's voice called: ‘My lord, my lord!"

‘Lord Hamlet!" shouted Marcellus.

The voices came nearer. ‘Heaven keep him safe,’ said Horatio.
‘Amen!’ shouted Hamlet.

They were peering through the mist. Horatio cupped his hands round his mouth and called like a
falconer. 'Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!"
Hamlet replied:'Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come!"
They came out of the bright morning mist.

‘Are you alright, my noble lord? said Marcellus.
‘What happened? said Horatio.

‘Oh, it was a marvel, said Hamlet.

‘Tell us, my good lord, said Horatio.

‘No, you'll reveal it,’ said Hamlet.

‘Not |, my lord, | swear, said Horatio.

‘Nor I, my lord,’ said Marcellus.

‘No-one would believe it. But you'll keep it a secret?’
‘Yes, my lord," said Horatio.

Marcellus nodded eagerly. 'l swear.”

‘There's not one villain living in all of Denmark who isn't a frightful rogue,’ said Hamlet.

‘It doesn't need a ghost, come from the grave, to tell us that,’ said Horatio. He and Marcellus looked
at each other, puzzled by this comment.
‘You're absolutely right, said Hamlet. And so, without any more ado, | think it would be fit that we
shake hands and part - you to your business or your pleasure, whatever it is, and I........ 'm going to

go and pray.’

‘Your words are wild and meaningless, my lord,” said Horatio.
‘I'm sorry they offend you. Heartily. Yes, indeed, heartily.’
‘There's no offence in them, my lord."

‘Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio. And a great deal of offence too. About this vision, it's an
honest ghost, let me tell that. As for your desire to know what happened between us, suppress it as
well as you can. And now, good friends, because you are friends - scholars and soldiers - grant me
one small request.’

‘Whatever it is, my lord, we will,” said Horatio.
‘Never tell anyone what you've seen tonight.”

They both assured him of that.
‘I swear," said Horatio

‘I too,’ said Marcellus.

Hamlet drew his sword. ‘On my sword,’ he said.
‘We've already sworn,’ said Marcellus.

‘On my sword. | insist."

A ghostly voice came from below: ‘Swear!"

‘Aha, boy!" exclaimed Hamlet. 'Is that you? Are you there, my honest friend, Truepenny? Come on,
you heard this fellow in the basement. Agree to swear.’

‘Word the oath, my lord.”
‘Never to say a word about what you've seen. Swear on my sword."
The ghostly voice came again: ‘Swear!’

Hamlet crouched and addressed the stone floor. ‘Hic et ubique? Then we'll move away.’ He walked
several paces away and beckoned the others. ‘Come here, gentlemen, and lay your hands on my
sword. Never to speak of this. Swear by my sword."

As they approached the voice came yet again.
‘There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But
come. Hamlet held his sword out. ‘Here, as you were going to do, swear that you will never, so help
you God, no matter how odd or strangely | behave - because perhaps at some stage | may think it
appropriate to put on an act - that you, seeing me at those times, will never, with such things as
folded arms, or a shake of the head, or by saying something like “well, well, well, we know”, or “we
could tell you if we wanted to”, or “our lips are sealed”, or “there are people who could explain this if
they wanted to”, or such ambiguous communication, to show that you know anything about me.
Don't do it. So that grace and mercy will help you when you need it most, swear.”
‘That | can keep your secrets and not my own. Anyway, to be interrogated by a sponge! What
rejoinder should the son of a king make?’

‘Do you take me for a sponge, my lord? said Rosencrantz.

‘Yes, sir, soaking up the king's face, his rewards, his offices. But such functionaries give the king the
best service in the end: like an ape, he keeps them in the corner of his jaw, first mouthed and finally
swallowed. When he needs what you've found out it's just a matter of squeezing you..." Hamlet made
the motion of squeezing a sponge: and sponge, you will be dry again.’

Rosencrantz’s patience abandoned him. ‘My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go with us
to the king."

‘The body is with the king, but the king is not with the body. The king is a thing...”
‘A thing, my lord! exclaimed Guildenstern.
'Of nothing,’ said Hamlet. Take me to him."

As they set off back Hamlet pretended to be riding a horse. ‘Hide fox, and tallyho!" he shouted.
Claudius sat with a group of advisers. ‘I have sent someone to look for him,” he told them. ‘And to
find the body. It's so dangerous that this man should be on the loose! But we mustn't apply strict law
to him. The shallow multitude who go by looks instead of judgment love him. And when that's so the
offender’s punishment is resented but never the offence. To calm everything this sudden exile must
be made to seem like a planned venture. Diseases that have become desperate must be cured by
desperate remedies or not at all.”

A guard showed Rosencrantz in.

‘How is it?’ said Claudius. ‘What's happened?

‘He won't tell us where he's hidden the body, my lord."
‘But where is he?’

‘Outside, my lord, guarded until you tell us what you want."
Rosencrantz went to the door. ‘Ho, Guildenstern! Bring my lord in.’

Hamlet smiled at the counsellors and bowed deeply to the king.

Claudius’ voice was gentle when he spoke. ‘Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?"
‘At supper.”

‘At supper! Where?'

‘Not where he eats, but where he is being eaten. A banqueting party of shrewd worms is at him right
now. Your worm is your only emperor for eating. We fatten animals to fatten ourselves and then we

fatten maggots. Your fat king and your thin beggar look like two different dishes but they end up on

the same table. That's the end."
‘A man may go fishing with the worm that ate the king and then eat the fish that fed on the worm.’
‘What do you mean by this? said Claudius.

‘Nothing, except to show you how a king may progress through the guts of a beggar.’

Claudius banged his fist on the table. ‘Where is Polonius?

‘In heaven. Send someone to see. If your messenger doesn't find him there, look for him in the other
place yourself. But if you don't find him by the end of the month you will smell him as you go
upstairs to the lobby."
PROLOGUE

‘Two households, both alike in dignity,
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,

From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,

‘Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.

From forth the fatal loins of these two foes

A pair of star-crossd lovers take their life;

‘Whose misadventured piteous overthrows.

Do with their death bury their parents'strife.

‘The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,

And the continuance of their parents' rage,

‘Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
s now the two hours' traffic of our stage;

‘The which if you with patient ears attend,

‘What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

GREGORY

‘That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
to the wall.

‘True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
to the wall.

they list.
ABRAHAM
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
SAMPSON

[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say
ay?

GREGORY
No.
SAMPSON

No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I

With all the admired beauties of Verona:

Go thither; and, with unatainted eye,
Compare her face with some that I shall show,
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

ROMEO

‘When the devout religion of mine eye
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
And these, who often drown'd could never die,
‘Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!

One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun

Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.

BENVOLIO

“Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
Herself poised with herself in either eye:
But in that crystal scales let there be w
Your lady's love against some other maid
‘That I will show you shining at this feast,
And she shall scant show well that now shows best.

ROMEO

Il go along, no such sight to be shown,
But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
She's not fourteen.

Nurse

Il lay fourteen of my teeth,~
And ye, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four—
She is not fourteen. How long is it now

To Lammas-tide?

LADY CAPULET
Afortnight and odd days.
Nurse

Even or odd, of all days in the year,

Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
‘Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;

She was too good for me: but, as I said,

On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
‘That shall she, marry; I remember it well.

“Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;

And she was wean'd, I never shall forget it~

Of all the days of the year, upon that day:

For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,

Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;

My lord and you were then at Mantua:—

Nay, I do bear a brain:~but, as I said,

‘When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,

To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!

Shake quoth the dove-house: ‘twas no need, I trow,
To bid me trudge:

And since that time it s eleven years;

For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
She could have run and waddled all about;

For even the day before, she broke her brow:
And then my husband~God be with his soul!

A’ was a merry man~took up the child:

*Yea," quoth he, ‘dost thou fall upon thy face?
‘Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
‘Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,

‘The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay."

To see, now, how a jest shall come about!

T warrant, an I should live a thousand years,

I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay."

LADY CAPULET
Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.

LADY CAPULET
Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
JULIET
And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say L.
Nurse
Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
‘Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
An I might live to see thee married once,
Ihave my wish.

LADY CAPULET

Marry, that ‘marry’ is the very theme
I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,

Itis an honour that I dream not of.
Nurse

An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
T'would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.

LADY CAPULET

‘Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,

Are made already mothers: by my count,

1 was your mother much upon these years

‘That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
‘The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
SCENE IV. A street.

Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others
ROMEO

‘What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
Or shall we on without a apology?

BENVOLIO

‘The date is out of such prolixity:
‘Welll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;

Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
After the prompter, for our entrance:

But let them measure us by what they will;
‘We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.

ROMEO

Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
Being but heavy, I will bear the light.

MERCUTIO

Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
ROMEO

Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes

‘With nimble soles: T have a soul of lead

So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
MERCUTIO

You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
And soar with them above a common bound.

ROMEO

Lam too sore enpierced with his shaft
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
1 cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
BENVOLIO

Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
But every man betake him to his legs.

ROMEO

Atorch for me: let wantons light of heart
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
Il be a candle-holder, and look on.

‘The game was nefer so fair, and 1 am done.

MERCUTIO

“Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable’s own word:
If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!

ROMEO
Nay, that's not so.
MERCUTIO
I mean, delay

‘We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.

Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits

Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
ROMEO

And we mean well in going to this mask;
But 'tis no wit to go.

MERCUTIO
‘Why, may one ask?
MERCUTIO

0, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
She s the fairies' midwife, and she comes.

In shape no bigger than an agate-stone

On the fore-finger of an alderman,

Drawn with a team of little atomies

Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;

Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
‘The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,

‘The traces of the smallest spider’s web,

‘The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,

Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,

Not so big as a round litcle worm

Prickd from the lazy finger of a maid;

Her chariot s an empty hazel-nut

Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,

‘Time out o’ mind the fairies' coachmakers.

And in this state she gallops night by night
‘Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
Oer lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
Oer ladies " lips, who straight on kisses dream,
‘Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier’s nose,

And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;

And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s ail
Tickling a parson's nose as a lies asleep,

‘Then dreams, he of another benefice:

Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier’s neck,

And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,

Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
And sleeps again. This i that very Mab

“That plats the manes of horses in the night,

And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
‘Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
‘This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
‘That presses them and learns them first to bear,
Making them women of good carriage:

“This is she—

SCENE V. A hall in Capulet's house.
Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins
First Servant

‘Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!

Second Servant

‘When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
hands and they unwashed too, 'ts a foul thing

First Servant
Away with the joint-stools, remove the
court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
Antony, and Potpan!

Second Servant
Ay, boy, ready.

First Servant

You are looked for and called for, asked for and
sought for, in the great chamber.

Second Servant

‘We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.

Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meeting the Guests and Maskers
ROMEO

0, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night

Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;

Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!

So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
As yonder lady o her fellows shows.

‘The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Did my heart love ill now? forswear i, sight!
For I neer saw true beauty till this night.

TYBALT

‘This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,

To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?

Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,

To strike him dead, T hold it not a sin.

CAPULET
‘Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
TYBALT
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,

Avillain that s hither come in spite,
“To scom at our solemnity this night.
TYBALT
‘Why, uncle, 'is a shame.
CAPULET

Goto, goto;

You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?

‘This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
You must contrary me! marry, ‘s time.

‘Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:

Be quiet, or-More light, more light! For shame!
T'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!

TYBALT

Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
T will withdraw: but this intrusion shall

Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.

Exit
ROMEO
[To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:

My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

JULIET

Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
‘Which mannerly devotion shows in this;

For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
ROMEO
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
JULIET
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
ROMEO

0, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
‘They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

JULIET

Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
ROMEO
‘What is her mother?

Nurse

Marry, bachelor,

Her mother is the lady of the house,

And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous

I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
Shall'have the chinks.

ROMEO

Is she a Capulet?
O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.

BENVOLIO

Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
ROMEO

Ay, so1 fear; the more is my unrest.

CAPULET

Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;

‘We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.

Is it €'en 502 why, then, I thank you all

I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
More torches here! Come on then, lets to bed.
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:

Il to my rest.

Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse
KING CLAUDIUS

Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
Moreover that we much did long to see you,

The need we have to use you did provoke

Our hasty sending. Something have you heard

Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,

Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
Resembles that it was. What it should be,

More than his father’s death, that thus hath put him
So much from the understanding of himself,

| cannot dream of: | entreat you both,

That, being of so young days brought up with him,
And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
Some little time: so by your companies

To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,

So much as from occasion you may glean,
Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
ROSENCRANTZ

Both your majesties

Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
Put your dread pleasures more into command
Than to entreaty.

GUILDENSTERN

But we both obey,

And here give up ourselves, in the full bent
To lay our service freely at your feet,

To be commanded.
QUEEN GERTRUDE

Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
And | beseech you instantly to visit

My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.

GUILDENSTERN

Heavens make our presence and our practises
Pleasant and helpful to him!

QUEEN GERTRUDE

Ay, amen!

Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and some Attendants
Enter POLONIUS

LORD POLONIUS
LORD POLONIUS

Have |, my lord? | assure my good liege,

I hold my duty, as | hold my soul,

Both to my God and to my gracious king:
And | do think, or else this brain of mine
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure

As it hath used to do, that | have found
The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.

KING CLAUDIUS
0, speak of that; that do | long to hear.
LORD POLONIUS

Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.

KING CLAUDIUS
Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.

Exit POLONIUS
VOLTIMAND

Most fair return of greetings and desires.
Upon our first, he sent out to suppress

His nephew’s levies; which to him appear'd

To be a preparation ‘gainst the Polack;

But, better look'd into, he truly found

It was against your highness: whereat grieved,
That so his sickness, age and impotence

Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine
Makes vow before his uncle never more

To give the assay of arms against your majesty.
KING CLAUDIUS

It likes us well;

And at our more consider'd time well read,
Answer, and think upon this business.

Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:

Most welcome home!

Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS
LORD POLONIUS

This business is well ended.

My liege, and madam, to expostulate

What majesty should be, what duty is,

Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,

And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
I will be brief: your noble son is mad:

Mad call 1 it; for, to define true madness,

What is't but to be nothing else but mad?

But let that go.
To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most
beautified Ophelia,-

That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; ‘beautified’ is
a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:

Reads

‘In her excellent white bosom, these, & ¢
QUEEN GERTRUDE

Came this from Hamlet to her?

LORD POLONIUS

Good madam, stay awhile; | will be faithful.

Reads
LORD POLONIUS

I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
When I had seen this hot love on the wing-

As | perceived it, | must tell you that,

Before my daughter told me-what might you,
Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,

If I had play'd the desk or table-book,

Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;

‘What might you think? No, | went round to work,
And my young mistress thus | did bespeak:
‘Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;

This must not be’ and then | precepts gave her,
That she should lock herself from his resort,
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
‘Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
And he, repulsed-a short tale to make-

Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,

Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
Into the madness wherein now he raves,

And all we mourn for.

KING CLAUDIUS
Do you think ‘tis this?
QUEEN GERTRUDE

It may be, very likely.
LORD POLONIUS

[Pointing to his head and shoulder]

Take this from this, if this be otherwise:

If circumstances lead me, | will find

Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
Within the centre.

KING CLAUDIUS
How may we try it further?
LORD POLONIUS

You know, sometimes he walks four hours together
Here in the lobby.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

So he does indeed.
LORD POLONIUS

At such a time Il loose my daughter to him:
Be you and | behind an arras then;

Mark the encounter: if he love her not

And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
Let me be no assistant for a state,

But keep a farm and carters.

KING CLAUDIUS

We will try it.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
LORD POLONIUS

Away, | do beseech you, both away:
I'll board him presently.

Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and Attendants
Enter HAMLET, reading

O, give me leave:
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
HAMLET

Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be
one man picked out of ten thousand.

LORD POLONIUS
That's very true, my lord.
HAMLET

For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a
god kissing carrion,-Have you a daughter?

LORD POLONIUS
I have, my lord.
HAMLET

Let her not walk i the sun: conception is a
blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.
Friend, look to ‘t.

LORD POLONIUS

[Aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my
daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said |
was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and
truly in my youth | suffered much extremity for
love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.
‘What do you read, my lord?

HAMLET

Words, words, words.
HAMLET

Words, words, words.

LORD POLONIUS

What is the matter, my lord?

HAMLET

Between who?

LORD POLONIUS

I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
HAMLET

Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here

that old men have grey beards, that their faces are
wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
though | most powerfully and potently believe, yet

I 'hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for
yourself, sir, should be old as | am, if like a crab

you could go backward.
