to me. If there's any good thing that has to be done that will give you peace and bring me grace,
speak to me. If you have any foreknowledge of your country’s fate, which perhaps prior knowledge
of may avoid, oh speak. Or if you have hoarded stolen treasure during your life, for which reasons,
they say, you spirits walk after death, tell me about it."

‘Stop it, Marcellus!" Horatio tried to grasp it but his hands went right through it.
‘Shall I hit it with my spear?’ said Marcellus.

‘Do so if it won't stop,’ said Horatio.

‘It's here!’ said Bernardo, pointing.

‘No, it's here! said Horatio.

‘It's gone,’ said Marcellus. 'We wronged it, being so majestical, by threatening it with violence. It's
invulnerable, like the air. Our antics were a mockery.’

‘It was about to speak when the cock crew,’ said Bernardo.
