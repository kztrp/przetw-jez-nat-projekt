And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
‘The earth hath swallowd all my hopes but she,
She s the hopeful lady of my earth:

But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,

My will to her consent s but a part;

An she agree, within her scope of choice

Lies my consent and fair according voice.

‘This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
Whereto I have invited many a guest,

Such as I love; and you, among the store,

One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
At my poor house look to behold this night
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel

‘When well-apparelld April on the heel

Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,

And like her most whose merit most shall be:
‘Which on more view, of many mine being one
May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
Come, go with me.

Go, sirrah, trudge about

‘Whose names are written there, and to them say,
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
