‘There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But
come. Hamlet held his sword out. ‘Here, as you were going to do, swear that you will never, so help
you God, no matter how odd or strangely | behave - because perhaps at some stage | may think it
appropriate to put on an act - that you, seeing me at those times, will never, with such things as
folded arms, or a shake of the head, or by saying something like “well, well, well, we know”, or “we
could tell you if we wanted to”, or “our lips are sealed”, or “there are people who could explain this if
they wanted to”, or such ambiguous communication, to show that you know anything about me.
Don't do it. So that grace and mercy will help you when you need it most, swear.”
