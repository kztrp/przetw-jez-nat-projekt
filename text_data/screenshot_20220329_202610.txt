BENVOLIO

‘Good-morrow, cousin.
ROMEO

Is the day so young?
BENVOLIO

But new struck nine.
ROMEO

Ay me! sad hours seem long.
‘Was that my father that went hence so fast?

BENVOLIO

It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
ROMEO

Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
BENVOLIO

In love?
ROMEO

Out--
BENVOLIO

Of love?
ROMEO

Out of her favour, where I am in love.
BENVOLIO

Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
