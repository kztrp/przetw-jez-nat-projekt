Claudius sat with a group of advisers. ‘I have sent someone to look for him,” he told them. ‘And to
find the body. It's so dangerous that this man should be on the loose! But we mustn't apply strict law
to him. The shallow multitude who go by looks instead of judgment love him. And when that's so the
offender’s punishment is resented but never the offence. To calm everything this sudden exile must
be made to seem like a planned venture. Diseases that have become desperate must be cured by
desperate remedies or not at all.”

A guard showed Rosencrantz in.

‘How is it?’ said Claudius. ‘What's happened?

‘He won't tell us where he's hidden the body, my lord."
‘But where is he?’

‘Outside, my lord, guarded until you tell us what you want."
